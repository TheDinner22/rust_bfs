// some ideas and sudo code
//
// need an array or array like struct or something (must somehow, loose-ly represent some space, 2d, 3d, etc.)
// (must have some smallest denominator of space i.e
// a block in minecraft, a square in chess, or a cell in conways game of life)
// that implements a BFS trait and a location trait
// location trait: somehow keep track of position in the space being represented and be able to
// move through that space (moving is a seperate trait??) 
// BFS trait: where you can call the trait to get all the possible moves from your current "location," 
// then spawn several locations (how can i spawn a trait) that do all possible moves and repeat
// until reaching some specified location the path to that location is the path of "least
// resistance" and is returned or something
//
// i have realized that there are some things about bfs i can assert! For example there must be
// paths that are vec<Move>. A path can only ever contain a cell once (they are sets no vecs). If
// two paths cross, the larger one is invalid
// i need to implement behavior for paths 
//
